We study conditional statements with Python

Marks = int(input("How many marks did you get? "))

if (Marks >= 90):
    print(f"You are in A+ Grade. You got {Marks} marks.")
elif (Marks < 40):
    print(f"You failed because you got only {Marks} marks.")
else:
    print(f"You passed with {Marks} marks.")

marks = [14,45,12,78,90,100,23,56,67,89]
marks.sort()
print(marks)
marks.append(100)
print(marks)
marks.pop()
print(marks)
list and tuple and strings
list 
list we can change its called to mutable
list stored only square brackets like this []
list sliceing
these are all the list methods
collection =["vikas ","kumain","chand","raj","suresh","kumar"]
print(collection)
collection[2]="rajkumar"
print(collection)
collection[0]="vikas kumar"
print(collection)
print(collection[-5])
collection.reverse()
print(collection)
collection.sort()
print(collection)
collection.append("rajkumar")     
print(collection)
collection.pop()
print(collection)
collection.remove("rajkumar")
# print(collection)
collection.insert(2,"rajkumar")
print(collection)
collection.clear()
print(collection)
collection.extend(["rajkumar","suresh"])
print(collection)
extend is used to add multiple values in list for last 
collection.count("rajkumar")



string = "vikas kumar"
print(string[-4])
it count all numbers of strings like black space and all and return the index each letter

string[0]="V"
print(string)
strings we can not change its called to immutable,

tuple
tuple we can not change its called to immutable     
names =("vikas ","kumain","chand","raj","suresh","kumar")
print(names)
print(names[2])
it also count all words of tuple each and every words not a letter then retruns 
names[2]="rajkumar"
print(names)
tuple object does not support item assignment
tuple stored only brackets like this ()
